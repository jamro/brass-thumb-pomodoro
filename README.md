# Brass Thumb Pomodoro

The Brass Thumb Pomodoro is a unique productivity timer inspired by the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) and designed in a delightful steampunk style. This timer, powered by the [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) platform, helps you manage work and rest periods effectively. With 25-minute work intervals followed by 5-minute breaks, the device features a side switch to set the mode. Upon completing a work session, a thumbs-up figure pops out as a reward. The entire gadget is USB-powered and designed with 3D-printed parts, making it portable and convenient to use.
