# Brass Thumb Pomodoro Assembly Guide

Welcome to the assembly guide for the Brass Thumb Pomodoro, your steampunk productivity timer. This guide is divided into two parts: 

1. **Preparation**: Assemble smaller components.
2. **Main Assembly**: Combine parts into the final device.

**Prerequisites**: Complete each step sequentially for a smooth assembly.

**Tools needed**: Mini screwdriver, USB power source.

Let's get started!

## Preparation

Before we dive into the main assembly of the Brass Thumb Pomodoro, we'll start by preparing a few smaller components. This step is essential as it will make the final assembly smoother and more efficient. Let's prepare each part carefully.

### Device Top Cover

**Mount Gauge Vent**: Place the `gauge_vent.stl` into the `gauge_cap.stl` as shown. Secure it with two M2x8 screws.

**Mount Gauge Gear**: Insert the `gauge_gear_small.stl` into the designated slot in `gauge_cap.stl`. Use one M2x16 screw to secure it in place.

### Thumb Up Popup

Prepare the popup mechanism for the Brass Thumb Pomodoro by following these steps:

Insert the 10mm diameter, 5mm height cylinder magnet into the bay of the thumb-up mechanism as shown in the image. The magnet's orientation is not important at this stage.

Ensure the magnet fits snugly in the bay. If itâ€™s loose, secure it using adhesive tape on the sides.

### Magnetic Handle
Use the cylinder magnet (D=10mm, h=5mm) as shown below. The orientation of the magnet does not matter at this stage. Place the magnet securely in the bay. If it is loose, use adhesive tape on the sides to tighten it.

### Rack Gear

Insert the M2x8 screw through the hole from the bottom side of the rack gear and tighten it until firmly held in place. This will be used later to mount other elements.
