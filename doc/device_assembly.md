# Brass Thumb Pomodoro Assembly Guide

Welcome to the assembly guide for the Brass Thumb Pomodoro, your steampunk productivity timer. This guide is divided into two parts: 

1. **Preparation**: Assemble smaller components.
2. **Main Assembly**: Combine parts into the final device.

**Prerequisites**: Complete each step sequentially for a smooth assembly.

**Tools needed**: Mini screwdriver, USB power source.

Let's get started!

## Preparation

Before we dive into the main assembly of the Brass Thumb Pomodoro, we'll start by preparing a few smaller components. This step is essential as it will make the final assembly smoother and more efficient. Let's prepare each part carefully.

### Device Top Cover

**Mount Gauge Vent**: Place the `gauge_vent.stl` into the `gauge_cap.stl` as shown. Secure it with two M2x8 screws.

### Thumb Up Popup

Prepare the popup mechanism for the Brass Thumb Pomodoro by following these steps:

Insert the 10mm diameter, 5mm height cylinder magnet into the bay of the thumb-up mechanism as shown in the image. The magnet's orientation is not important at this stage.
